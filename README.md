# Journey to the West (Modern Edition) | 《西游记（白话版）》

This project is a modern retelling of the classical Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, which is in the public domain. Our goal is to make the text more accessible and reader-friendly for contemporary audiences in multiple languages.

- **Original Work**: *Journey to the West* (Public Domain).  
- **Adaptation**: The rewritten modern-text version is created by me (and project contributors), aiming to simplify and update the language for modern readers.

## Directory Structure

We organize the content by language folders. Each language folder may contain multiple subdirectories, such as chapters, notes, etc.

- `simplified-chinese/`  
  - `chapters/`: Contains chapters in modern Simplified Chinese (简体中文).  
- `traditional-chinese/`  
  - `chapters/`: Contains chapters in modern Traditional Chinese (繁体中文).  
- `english/`  
  - `chapters/`: Contains chapters in English.  
  - `notes/`: Annotations, references, or rewrite methodology in English.  
  - `notes/`: Annotations, references, or rewrite methodology in Chinese.  
- `LICENSE`: The full text of the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.  
- `README.md`: This English documentation.  
- `README.zh.md`: The Chinese documentation.

In the future, if we add more languages (e.g., `french/`, `japanese/`), we will follow the same folder structure.
